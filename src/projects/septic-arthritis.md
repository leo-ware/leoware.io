Statistical analysis for a retrospective study examining glenohumeral septic arthritis in intravenous drug users versus non-users at a tertiary care center in Appalachia.

## Overview

This project involved conducting the statistical analysis for a 10-year retrospective study (2015-2025) at West Virginia University Hospital System. The study examined 53 cases of glenohumeral (shoulder) septic arthritis to assess associations between intravenous drug use and clinical outcomes.

I was responsible for all statistical analysis, including hypothesis testing, creating summary tables, and calculating the statistics reported in the manuscript.

## Key Findings

- **Higher IV drug use prevalence:** 37.7% of glenohumeral septic arthritis cases involved recent IV drug use—higher than previously reported in the literature (5-27.8%)
- **Age differences:** Mean age of 39.9 years in IV drug users vs. 60.8 years in non-users (p < 0.001)
- **Systemic complications:** IV drug users had significantly higher rates of sepsis (85% vs 33%, p < 0.001), bacteremia (95% vs 55%, p = 0.002), and endocarditis (55% vs 9%, p < 0.001)

## Statistical Methods

- Chi-square tests and Fisher's exact tests for categorical comparisons
- ANOVA for continuous variables
- Comparison of proportions across IV drug user and non-user cohorts
- Analysis of imaging findings, pathogen cultures, and treatment outcomes
