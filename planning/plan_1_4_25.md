# Website Update Instructions for leoware.io

This document contains specific instructions for updating Leo Ware's personal website. The goal is to reposition the site for a pharma biostatistics job search.

---

## Homepage (leoware.io/)

**Current text:**
> "I'm currently a Master's student in biostatistics at West Virginia University working on extreme event modeling in time series data."

**Change to:**
> "I'm a Master's student in Biostatistics at West Virginia University, graduating May 2026. My research focuses on causal inference methods for healthcare applications."

**Also:**
- Add email contact (leobpware@gmail.com) alongside the social icons, or make it more prominent

---

## About Page (leoware.io/about)

**Current text has these problems:**
- References "extreme event modeling in time series" (no longer his focus)
- Heavy EA language ("AI safety or biosecurity," "counterfactual impact robust to median timelines") that may confuse pharma hiring managers
- No mention of causal inference, which is his main angle

**Replace the entire About text with:**

> I'm a Master's student in Biostatistics at West Virginia University, graduating May 2026. My research focuses on causal inference methods for healthcare applications.
>
> My background combines statistical methodology with hands-on implementation. For my undergraduate thesis at Minerva University, I worked on causal identification algorithms and found a bug in Microsoft Research's DoWhy library that was invalidating roughly half of their significance tests. I built my own implementation that was more general and 60% faster.
>
> I've also worked as an AI engineering intern at Rhetoric, where I built LLM-based extraction pipelines, and done contract development for startups building ML-powered products. I write Python, R, TypeScript, and occasionally Rust.
>
> I did my undergrad at Minerva University, where I studied statistics and computer science and had the chance to spend semesters in San Francisco, London, Seoul, Berlin, Buenos Aires, and Taipei.
>
> In my free time, I enjoy cooking, epistemology, and wandering around in countries where I don't speak the language.

## Projects Page (leoware.io/projects)

**Current projects listed:**
- Antimemetics (blog post)
- Game theory compilation (blog post)  
- Causal inference four-stage framework (blog post)

**Replace with these projects:**

**1. pqp - Causal Identification Algorithm**
- Description: "High-performance implementation of Shpitser's ID algorithm for causal identification, written in Rust. While working on this project, I found a bug in Microsoft Research's DoWhy library that was invalidating ~50% of significance tests. My implementation is more general and 60% faster than Microsoft's version."
- GitHub link: https://github.com/leo-ware/pqp

**2. fast-matching-inference**
- Description: "KD-trees for best-case linear time implementation of Abadie & Diamond's statistical matching procedure for causal inference."
- GitHub link: https://github.com/leo-ware/fast-matching-inference

**3. (Optional) Keep the "Causal Inference, a Four-Stage Framework" article if it's substantive. Otherwise remove it.**

**Remove:**
- Antimemetics post
- Game theory list
