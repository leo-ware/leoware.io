Some simple game theoretic models with solutions

## Solution concepts
- nash equilibrium
	- mixed nash equilibrium
	- iterated nash equilibrium
- replicator dynamics/ess
- what do humans do

## Games
#### Prisoner's Dilemma

| | A | B
| - | - | - |
| | | 0 |

	- Iterated version is solvable
	- ESS and Axelrod experiments
- Stag hunt
	- Coordination
	- Tend to see lots of hype and bluster (aka Silicon Valley)
- Driving
	- Stag hunt but with multiple "good" outcomes
	- Schelling points
- Chicken
	- Credible commitment
	- Simultaneous vs sequential games
	- Hawks and doves replicator dynamics
- Pie slicing
	- No nash equilibrium
	- Tend to see lots of negotiating and instability
- Soccer
	- Rules
		- Simultaneous game played between the kicker and the goalie
		- Kicker kicks right or left, goalie dives right or left
		- If kicker kicks left (or right) and goalie dives left (right), the kicker wins. Otherwise the goalie wins.
	- Mixed strategies
- Lemons
	- Asymmetric information
- Nim
	- Zugzwang
- Mexican Standoff
	- Truel
- Ponzi
	- Is there a nontrivial Nash equilibrium here?
- Money auction
	- I hold an auction for a $20 bill, but you have to pay you bid whether you win or not.
- Lottery auction
	- Winner's curse
- Non zero-sum games
	- Some cash transfer will lead to the highest sum option
- Smart cow
	- conjunctive vs disjunctive victory conditions
	- FUD strategies
